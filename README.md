# Modularized Configurations

This is a Python package which enables to modularize configuration files.

In configuration-based applications, it is sometimes desirable to group
sections in a configuration file. This can, for instance, be sections which are for a specific purpose, e.g. modules in an application which shall be configurable.

For this purpose, `modconf` add the functionality to define custom `Tag`s representing groups in a configuration file. For instance, if you have an application with multiple modules you can define the tag `Module: ` and add that prefix to each section in the configuration file describing a certain module.
